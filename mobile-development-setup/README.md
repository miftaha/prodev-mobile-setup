# ðŸ“± Mobile Development Environment Setup

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Mobile development requires more computational resources than web development. To simplify the process, we are using the **Expo Framework for React Native**, which allows us to develop and test mobile apps efficiently.

This guide covers setting up Expo Go on a physical device and documenting any challenges encountered.
